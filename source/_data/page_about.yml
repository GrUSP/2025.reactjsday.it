    "reactjsday is proudly organised by <a href='http://www.grusp.org'>GrUSP.</a> <br>
    GrUSP is a community founded in 2003 as a PHP User Group, that has become the reference point in Italy for good practice in all fields of web development.
    We have been organising community-oriented conferences since then, always pursuing the goal of creating opportunities for people to meet, learn, share and grow together."

    "GrUSP is a non-profit organisation whose aim is to improve a healthier and sustainable web development ecosystem in Italy. We organise affordable, high-quality events and workshops for developers and promote the creation of local user groups (PUG), helping them in their activities. <br>
    Diversity and inclusion have always been at the heart of our initiative. We have been applying a code of conduct for many years, and we have scholarship programs for each of our conferences."

    "<p>We organize plenty of tech conferences in Italy, involving both Italian and international professionals. The topics we cover range from web development languages and frameworks (Angular, React, Symfony, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.) to DevOps and security technologies, and also web design-related topics (UX and CSS). We also organize Product Management Day, the first Italian conference dedicated to product management.<br>&nbsp;<br>
    These are unique events, combining workshops, technical talks, and important networking opportunities. During our conferences, attendees have the chance to connect with top professionals, exchange innovative ideas, and discover the latest industry trends.
