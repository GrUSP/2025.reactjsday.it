        talk_description: |
          React developers rely every day on tools like Vite, Webpack, or Rollup, but what actually happens when you npm run build? What's inside those "bundlers" and how do they turn your JSX and node_modules soup into fast, production-ready apps?<br><br>

          In this talk, we'll reverse-engineer the React build pipeline from the ground up. We'll explore how bundlers parse your code using ASTs, resolve dependencies, apply tree-shaking and code-splitting, and implement dev-time features like Hot Module Replacement. We'll also see what makes Vite fundamentally different, and why it matters for React performance and DX.<br><br>

          Whether you're debugging a slow build or just curious what's behind the curtain, this is the deep dive you didn't know you needed.

        talk_description: |
          How can minimalism in React component design improve your codebase?<br><br>
          
          This talk explores the value of keeping React components lean, focusing on reducing their interfaces to the Minimum Viable Interface (MVI). Learn how this practice makes components easier to:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>- Test</li>
          <li>- Maintain</li>
          <li>- Replace</li>
          </ul>
          
          While fostering better collaboration and consistency across teams. If you're looking for scalable strategies to maintain agility in your React applications, this talk is for you.

        talk_title: "The Great Modularization: How We Scaled a 15-Team React Native App Without Losing Our Minds"
        talk_description: |
          What happens when 15+ teams collaborate on the same modular React Native app?<br><br>
          
          In this talk, I'll share the architectural evolution of a platform designed for scale from day one — and the challenges we faced as the number of modules, contributors, and cross-cutting concerns grew.<br><br>

          We'll dive into:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>- Our modular structure</li>
          <li>- How we apply microfrontend principles in mobile</li>
          <li>- How we introduced server-driven UI to empower product teams</li>
          </ul>
          
          We'll also reflect on what it means to lead a platform team in this context — balancing autonomy and consistency while enabling fast, accessible, and scalable development across the organization.

        talk_description: |
          Ladies and gentlemen, TypeScript's utility types are the Freddie Mercury of static typing: bold, versatile, and absolutely iconic.<br><br>
          
          In this session, we'll take you on a Greatest Hits tour of every utility type, from Partial to OmitThisParameter, going through Capitalize and many more.<br><br>

          We'll crank the volume up to React 19: jamming on:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>- Server Components</li>
          <li>- Suspense</li>
          <li>- The brand-new Actions API</li>
          </ul>
          
          Pairing each feature with its perfect utility-type riff.<br><br>

          At the end of the talk we'll be ready to rock production code harder than Queen at Wembley '86!

        talk_description: |
          A useMemo here, a useCallback there, sprinkle in a memo. Is this a codebase or a jungle of optimisation hacks? But wait… why are *we* doing the framework's job?<br><br>

          Lucky for us, React Compiler is here, and It promises to:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>- Fine-tune our code automatically</li>
          <li>- Let us focus on shipping features</li>
          <li>- Handle optimisation for us</li>
          </ul>

          Finally, you can focus your time on resolving business issues rather than framework mistakes!<br><br>

          In this talk, we'll explore:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>- How the React Compiler works</li>
          <li>- What it can (and can't) do for our project</li>
          <li>- How it's changing the way we think about performance in React</li>
          </ul>

          Say goodbye to optimisation and hello to shipping features… faster. Unlock the compiler's magic and let React do what It was always supposed to do—*just work*.

          As teams and apps grow, micro-frontends offer a way to scale — but managing state and communication across modules gets tricky.<br><br>
          
          In this talk, I'll explore:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>- How to structure micro-frontends in React and Next.js</li>
          <li>- How to manage different types of state</li>
          <li>- How to keep everything in sync across backends, auth, and storage</li>
          </ul>
          
          Whether you're considering micro-frontends or already working with them, this talk will help you avoid the pain points and build modular systems that still feel cohesive.

        talk_description: |
          In this talk, we'll walk through real examples of where state decisions went sideways:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>- Apps that became impossible to debug</li>
          <li>- Companies that had to rewrite their frontends because of poor architectural choices</li>
          </ul>
          
          Then, I'll walk you through a beginner-friendly decision framework you can use to avoid those same mistakes.<br><br>
          
          You'll learn:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>- How to recognize when a state tool is working against you</li>
          <li>- The three most common mistakes teams make with local, global, and server state</li>
          <li>- How to future-proof your app by asking better questions at the start</li>
          </ul>
          
          This talk is honest, practical, and full of lessons I wish I had when I started building in React. It's for developers who are tired of guessing and want a better way to think about state, scale, and sanity.
